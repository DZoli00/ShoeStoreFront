# PTOJECT_PS: Shoe Store

 - The project represents a shoe store.


--- BACKEND ---
 - The user can register to the site, and see all the available and unavailable shoes in the store.
 He can select one or more types of shoes. He can create an orderList by adding the selected shoes to the cart and then putting the orderList. The user can even modify his profile and all data on his profile, except the username.
 The admin has more options than a regular user. He can add, delete, modify and see all the shoes in the store. The admin can even modify the users' data.

 - At the start of the project the database is populated with some datas, which are defined in the configuration class or readed froma  CSV file.
 - The project contains four entitites: User, Product, Category and Order.
 - Between the entitites there are some relationships, like OneToMany for example between Category and Product, or User and Orders.

 - The User can create theri own orders, by selecting all the products they want to buy

After the register the aplication reddirect the user back to the login page. Or he can go there by clicking the here button.

- After sign in, it appears th categories and an add category button, which will be implemented after.
